# Sprint 564 validation evidence

## H2 atlas census baseline (2026-11-05)

A fresh, narrow comparison on the local macOS development-role environment
reproduced the existing census failures with isolated source archives. Both
variants used the same pinned dependency snapshot and coreutils source:
`eb3f31c0df7d8ed5180549d27f55571d1d50d2bf`.

| Variant | Exact yoke source | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before H2 | `2c22ccb619d432d4f3b71c57e6a65c80c4e3af64` | FAIL, exit 1 |
| H2 candidate | `6f6608d069083fb46a675814ecd670b1e6d96f3c` | FAIL, exit 1 |

Each variant ran only the existing test:

```sh
GOFLAGS=-mod=readonly go test ./pkg/atlas \
    -run '^TestCensusCoversEveryPackage$' -count=1 -v
```

`GOWORK` selected each isolated variant's workspace with the same dependency
sources. The supplied validation snapshot was read without modification; no
atlas rows, test expectations or known-failure records were changed.

Both runs reported exactly these failures at `packages_test.go:77`:

```text
pkg/nativepath has no atlas census entry.
pkg/nfthelper has no atlas census entry.
```

Both missing package entries belong to yoke. The
[existing census test](https://github.com/qiangli/yoke/blob/2c22ccb619d432d4f3b71c57e6a65c80c4e3af64/pkg/atlas/packages_test.go#L66)
checks the union of the yoke and selected coreutils package directories.
The two failures are unchanged from the exact baseline; **the test is not
passing**. This comparison establishes no regression for these two identities,
not a clean atlas suite or full Sprint 564 acceptance.

The manager retains the two source manifests, raw logs and machine-readable
comparison in the local Sprint 564 evidence bundle, identified as
`census-baseline` and `census-h2`. Test ownership, role-based host context and
remaining acceptance follow the master's
[evidence and completion rules](plan-s564-master-execution.md#evidence-and-completion).
Other operating systems and the remaining H5/H7 checks need their own matching
candidate evidence.
