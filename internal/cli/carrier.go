// `$!` would fall back to the synthetic "g<N>" handle — which external tools
// (and the POSIX certification suite: tetapi.sh does integer comparisons on
// tet_context=$!) cannot probe or signal. With interp.WithJobCarrier wired,
// the runner instead starts one helper per background job and uses its real
// PID as the job's identity; see internal/cli/carrier_unix.go.
