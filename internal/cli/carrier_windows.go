// platformJobCarrier returns the OS-backed job carrier for Windows: one
// re-exec of this executable in helper mode per background job (see
// MaybeRunJobCarrierHelper), giving every `cmd &` a real, probeable,
// signalable kernel PID for `$!`.
//
// A carrier is pure process identity, and Windows has that: CreateProcess
// hands back a process id, OpenProcess answers `kill -0`, and the shell's own
// `kill` already speaks the Windows dialect of every signal
// (sendsignal_windows.go) — TerminateProcess with bashy's exit-code marker for
// a terminating one, ntdll suspend/resume for a stop. None of fork, waitpid or
// POSIX process groups is needed to be a stand-in process.
//
// What Windows cannot host is the *live signal proxy* carrier_unix.go builds
// on fd 3: os/exec rejects ExtraFiles there, so there is no private inherited
// descriptor to relay catchable signals over. This is therefore a basic
// [interp.JobCarrier], the contract WithJobCarrier documents for one: the
// carrier keeps its default dispositions, an external `kill` decides the job's
// fate by killing the carrier, and the runner relays that signal to the job
// when it reaps it — still running the job's trap, still honouring an ignore,
// still killing an untrapped job as 128+signal. The one thing it gives up is
// surviving a trapped or ignored signal: after the first `kill $!` the carrier
// PID is gone, while the job itself carries on if its disposition says so.

// The readiness/event descriptor is a Unix mechanism (see carrier_unix.go).
// A Windows carrier installs no handler to become usable — its PID is live and
// signalable the moment CreateProcess returns — and has no descriptor to
// publish readiness on, so both hooks are empty here.
